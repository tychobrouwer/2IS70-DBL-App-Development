# 2IS70 App Development

The code for the course 2IS70 App Development of group 23.

## User Groups and Problem Addressed 

The app addresses issues of common littering locations and aims to promote sustainability and cleanliness by mapping littering locations and helping to predict trash build-ups. The user groups involved are residents or people passing by, who will take photos with location and trash type tags which are uploaded to a server and processed, and city councils, government or volunteer organisations who will use the app to check “hotspots” and report if they have resolved the issue in a specific location.

## General Features

### Connectivity

Users would be able to create accounts. The accounts could be used to track, document, and share user accomplishments statistics. The server would store the accounts and the littering location information. It would manipulate this information to send it efficiently to the device.

### User Interface

The application would have several views for entering new locations, viewing existing documented entries in the database, and managing the app's settings and user’s account. The map containing existing littering locations would have several features for viewing and browsing the littering information. The view for entering new locations would need several input fields for specifying data about the finding including adding photos.

### Hardware Features

The GPS location feature of the device will be used for tracking and mapping littering locations in the neighbourhood. Also, the type and exact location of the littering can be documented by taking a picture of the trash with the device's camera.

### Different Screens

The app will have an adapted interface for a phone and tablet. The user will also be able to rotate the screen supporting both portrait and landscape views.

### User Roles/Activities

The first important activity is to view all registered littering locations and their information. This activity has a map with markers and a fragment for viewing the litter data. A second activity would be to add a new littering location to the database. Here, fragments of the activity would include a camera view and a form to fill with the information. These activities are available to all users. Verified government or community accounts will be able to report that a specific area has been cleaned up using an additional activity only visible to these accounts.
